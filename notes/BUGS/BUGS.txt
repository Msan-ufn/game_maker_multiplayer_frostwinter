KNOWN ISSUES

ISSUE#001 [severity high, gameplay]
players logging later on the match will not be in sync with others 
(ie, cut trees will not be cut for new player) 
this happens because trees are updated on hit 
a more robust solution may be needed but time constrains will probably hold it back 

temprorary soution would be force all players be connected the moment the game starts

SOLVED
