Marcelo "S". A. N. MULTIPLAYER GAME FORSTWINTER phase 1

this tutorial will guide us through a few phases of making a working multiplayer experience.

phase 1 will be the connection only 
phase 2 connecting with identifier 
phase 3 will be the simple moviment of players and synch of those
phase 4 will be the complete game itself


a few quirks to note

most vars declared by me will have a handler , usually 'slv'
which stands for 'Shoyos Local Var' 
it is used for my own organization , it will usually go with 

"S??_ourdefinedname"

first 'S' will be always "S"

first '?' will be the scope of the variable usually (L Local, G Global,F Father, T Temporary, etc...

second '?' will be the type of variable (V - 'var' genral variable, F - function , A - Array, etc...-

so slf_step_update means its a local function, and probably is located on the create event

sgf_something is a global function and will be located on the script_global_vars_and_functions
